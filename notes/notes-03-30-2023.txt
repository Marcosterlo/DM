The final part on the comparison between the different timers:
One method is accurate and not precise (sleep function)
One method is precise and not accurate (usleep function)
One method is both precise and accurate (custom function) but:
  It is not threaded so it occupies the whole CPU the whole time and boils it.
  It is influenced by higher priority system interrupt so it shows some random peaks where the delay is very high, for this reason if we want a real time implementation in a small time window this could not be a good idea to implement since a delay spike could happne in the short time windows and mess everything up
